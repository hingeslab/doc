# Audits and Bug Bounty

## Have the HedgePlus token contracts been audited?

* Yes, HedgePlus Smart contracts and related source materials were audited by independent security researchers. We are hiring a top Smart Contract Audit Company to go through the smart contracts and implement a comprehensive audit before launching. Security for users is a top priority at HedgePlus. We will run one of the more extensive bounty programs in the space ($250,000), and we will be teaming up with Immunefi (https://immunefi.com/) to give it more visibility. Of course, we cannot guarantee that bugs won't be found in the future.
